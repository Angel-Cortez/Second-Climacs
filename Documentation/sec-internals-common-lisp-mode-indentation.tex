\section{Computing indentation}
\label{sec-internals-common-lisp-mode-indentation}

\subsection{Introduction}

There are two basic cases for computing indentation of some parse
result:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the parse result is a top-level parse result, then the
  indentation is always 0, i.e. it should be positioned in the
  leftmost column.
\item If the parse result is a nested parse result, then the
  indentation is relative to some ancestor parse result.
\end{enumerate}

The first case is trivial.  For the second case, computing indentation
is a top-down procedure applied to the children of some parse result
$P$.  It is assumed that the indentation (absolute or relative) of $P$
has already been computed, either because it is a top-level parse
result, or because its indentation was computed relative to some
ancestor.

We must distinguish between the following cases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $P$ is an atomic parse result.
\item $P$ represents a special form or a function or macro call with
  its own indentation rule
\item $P$ represents a function call without its own indentation rule.
\item $P$ represents a macro call without its own indentation rule.
\end{enumerate}

In case 1,  we are done because its indentation has already been
computed.

\subsection{Special indentation rules}

\subsection{Indenting a function call}

If $P$ represents a function call, then its children are indented
according to the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item If $P$ has at least two children and the second child is
  positioned on the same line as the first child, then the remaining
  children (starting with the third one) are indented so that they
  align with the second child.
\item If either $P$ has only one child (which must then be the
  function to be called), or the second child is not positioned on the
  same line as the first child, then every child is indented by two
  positions relative to $P$.
\end{itemize}
