\section{Cache representation}
\label{app-cache-representation}

The sequence of top-level parse results is split into a \emph{prefix}
and a \emph{suffix}, typically reflecting the current position in the
buffer being edited by the end user.  The suffix contains parse
results in the order they appear in the buffer, whereas the prefix
contains parse results in reverse order, making it easy to move parse
results between the prefix and the suffix.
