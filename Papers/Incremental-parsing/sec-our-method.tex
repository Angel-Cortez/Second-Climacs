\section{Our technique}

Our incremental parser parses the contents of a line-oriented buffer,
specified in the form of a \clos{} protocol
\cite{Strandh:2016:CPE:3005729.3005732}.  The buffer is line-oriented
in two different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The editing operations specified by the protocol define a
  \emph{line} abstraction, in contrast to a buffer of GHU Emacs
  \cite{Finseth:1980:TPTa} which exposes a single sequence containing
  newline characters to indicate line separation.
\item The update protocol works on the granularity of a line.  An
  entire line can be reported as being modified, inserted, or
  deleted.
\end{enumerate}

For the purpose of this paper, the update protocol is the part of the
buffer protocol that we are interested in, because we re-parse the
buffer as a result of the update protocol having been invoked.
