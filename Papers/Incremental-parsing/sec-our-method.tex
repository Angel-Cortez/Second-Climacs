\section{Our technique}

\subsection{Buffer update protocol}
\label{sec-buffer-update-protocol}

Our incremental parser parses the contents of a buffer, specified in
the form of a \clos{} protocol
\cite{Strandh:2016:CPE:3005729.3005732}.  The protocol contains two
sub-protocols:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{edit protocol} is used whenever items are inserted or
  deleted from the buffer.  An edit operation is typically invoked as
  a result of a keystroke, but an arbitrary number of edit operations
  can happen as a result of a keystroke, for example when a region is
  inserted or deleted, or when a keyboard macro is executed.
\item The \emph{update protocol} is used when the result of an
  arbitrary number of edit operations must be displayed to the user.
  This protocol is typically invoked for each keystroke, but it can be
  invoked less frequently if some view of the buffer is temporarily
  hidden.  Only when the view becomes visible is the update protocol
  invoked.
\end{enumerate}

The buffer protocol is \emph{line-oriented} in two different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The editing operations specified by the protocol define a
  \emph{line} abstraction, in contrast to a buffer of GNU Emacs
  \cite{Finseth:1980:TPTa} which exposes a single sequence containing
  newline characters to indicate line separation.
\item The update protocol works on the granularity of a line.  An
  entire line can be reported as being modified, inserted, or
  deleted.
\end{enumerate}

For the purpose of this paper, we are only interested in the update
protocol, because we re-parse the buffer as a result of the update
protocol having been invoked.  We can think of such an invocation as
resulting in a succession of operations, sorted by lines in increasing
order.  There can be three different update operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Modify.  The line has been modified.
\item Insert.  A new line has been inserted.
\item Delete.  An existing line has been deleted.
\end{itemize}

In order to parse the buffer contents, we use a custom \texttt{read}
function.  This version of the \texttt{read} function differs from the
standard one in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of returning S-expressions, it returns a nested
  structure of instances of a standard class named
  \texttt{parse-result}.  These instances contain the corresponding
  S-expression and the start and end position (line, column) in the
  buffer of the parse result.
\item The parse results returned by the reader also include entities
  that would normally not be returned by \texttt{read} such as
  comments and, more generally, results of applying reader macros
  that return no values.
\item Instead of attempting to call \texttt{intern} in order to turn a
  token into a symbol, the custom reader returns an instance of a
  standard class named \texttt{token}.
\end{itemize}

The reader from the \sicl{} project%
\footnote{See: https://github.com/robert-strandh/SICL.}  was slightly
modified to allow this kind of customization, thereby avoiding the
necessity of maintaining the code for a completely separate reader.

No changes to the mechanism for handling reader macros is necessary.
Therefore, we handle custom reader macros as well.  Whenever a reader
macro calls \texttt{read} recursively, a nested parse result is
created in the same way as with the standard reader macros.

The buffer update protocol is typically invoked after each keystroke
by the end user, and the modifications to the buffer are typically
very modest, in that usually a single line has been modified.  It
would be wasteful, and too slow for large buffers, to re-parse the
entire buffer character by character, each time the update protocol is
invoked.  For that reason, we keep a \emph{cache} of parse results
returned by the customized reader.

\subsection{Cache organization}

The cache is organized as a sequence%
\footnote{Here, we use the word \emph{sequence} in the meaning of a
  set of items organized consecutively, and not in the more
  restrictive meaning defined by the \commonlisp{} standard.}  of
top-level parse results.  Each top-level parse result contains the
parse results returned by nested calls to the reader.  Here, we are
not concerened with the details of the representation of the cache.
Such details are crucial in order to obtain acceptable performance,
but they are unimportant for understanding the general technique of
incremental parsing.  Refer to \refapp{app-cache-representation} for an
in-depth description of these details.

When the buffer is updated, we try to maintain as many parse results
as possible in the cache.  Updating the cache according to a
particular succession of update operations consists of two distinct
phases:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Invalidation of parse results that span a line that has been
  modified, inserted, or deleted.
\item Rehabilitation of the cache according to the updated buffer
  contents.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Invalidation phase}

As mentioned in \refSec{sec-buffer-update-protocol}, the invocation of
the buffer-update protocol results in a sequence descriptions of
operations that describe how the buffer has changed from the previous
invocation.

As far as the invalidation phase is concerned, there are only minor
variations in how the different types of operations are handled.  In
all cases (line modification, line insertion, line deletion), the
existing parse results that straddle a place that has been altered
must be invalidated.  Notice that when a top-level parse result
straddles such a modification, that parse result is invalidated, but
It is very likely that several of its children do not straddle the
point of modification.  Therefore such children are not invalidated,
and are kept in the cache in case they are needed during the
rehabilitation phase.

In addition to the parse results being invalidated as described in the
previous paragraph, when the operation represents the insertion or the
deletion of a line, remaining valid parse results following the point
of the operation must be modified to reflect the fact that they now
have a new start-line position.

As described in \refApp{app-cache-representation}, we designed the
data structure carefully both so that invalidating parse results as a
result of these operations, and modifying the start-line position of
remaining valid parse results can be done at very little cost.
