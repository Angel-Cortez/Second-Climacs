\section{Performance of our technique}

It is hard to give complete performance results for our technique,
simply because performance depends on many factors such as the exact
structure of the buffer contents and the way the user interacts with
that contents.

Despite these difficulties, we can give some indications for certain
important special cases.

\subsection{Parsing with an empty cache}

When a buffer is first created, the cache is empty.  The buffer
contents must then be read, character by character, and the cache must
be created from the contents.

We timed this situation with a buffer containing $10000$ lines of
\commonlisp{} code.  The total time to parse was around $2$ seconds.
This result deserves some clarifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is very unusual to have a file of \commonlisp{} code with
  this many lines.  Most files contain less than $2000$ lines, or
  $1/5$ of the one in our test case.
\item This result was obtained from a very preliminary version of our
  parser.  In particular, to read a character, several generic
  functions where called, including the \texttt{stream-read-char}
  function of the Gray streams library, and then several others in
  order to access the character in the buffer.
\item This situation will happen only when a buffer is initially read
  into the editor.  Even very significant subsequent changes to the
  contents will still preserve large portions of the cache, so that
  the number of characters actually read will only be a tiny fraction
  of the total number of characters in the buffer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parsing after small modifications}

To get an idea of performance during normal editing, we measured the
time to update the cache after a single character was added or deleted
to an existing symbol nested inside a top-level function definition.

For a small function ($10$ lines) with a nesting depth of $4$, we
measured a total time for update to around $5ms$ when the inserted or
deleted character was at the deepest nesting level, which is the least
favorable situation.

For a much larger function ($136$ lines) with a nesting depth of $12$,
the time for update varied according to the nesting level affected by
the inserted or deleted character.  For a small nesting depth, we
obtained an update time of $12ms$, and for large nesting depth, we
obtained a time of $30ms$.
